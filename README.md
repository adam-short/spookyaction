# SpookyAction
SpookyAction is a framework for desktop automation - it takes a configuration-based approach to utilising the PyAutoGUI. At the core of the framework is the `Item` class. It uses the concept of silent chaining to make writing automated flows quick and simple. 

SpookyAction is currently in early alpha, with a huge number of features to be written, things to be refactored and issues to be squashed. The ultimate goal is to create a simplistic, high level way to automate flows across both desktop interactions, API calls and Headless browser usage.

For the moment it is strongly advised that you **do not use this in real world projects.**.
